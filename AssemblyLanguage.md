# The CPU
- The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the physical device that performs
instructions. The instructions that CPUs perform are generally very simple.
Instructions may require the data they act on to be in special storage locations in the CPU itself called registers. The CPU can access data in registers
much faster than data in memory. However, the number of registers in a
CPU is limited, so the programmer must take care to keep only currently
used data in registers. 
- The instructions a type of CPU executes make up the CPU’s machine
language. Machine programs have a much more basic structure than higherlevel languages. Machine language instructions are encoded as raw numbers,
not in friendly text formats. A CPU must be able to decode an instruction’s
purpose very quickly to run efficiently. Machine language is designed with
this goal in mind, not to be easily deciphered by humans. Programs written
in other languages must be converted to the native machine language of
the CPU to run on the computer. A compiler is a program that translates
programs written in a programming language into the machine language of
a particular computer architecture. In general, every type of CPU has its
own unique machine language.
